üìå 1. Validation Logic (on signup and login)
‚úÖ Checks for empty fields (email, password, fullName)

‚úÖ Password length check (minimum 6 characters)

‚úÖ Validates email format using Regex

‚úÖ Prevents duplicate user registration by checking if the email already exists in the database

üîí 2. Password Hashing and Matching
‚úÖ You should be using Mongoose pre-save hook in your User model to hash passwords

user.matchPassword(password) is a method to compare plain vs hashed password using bcrypt

üí° Make sure your User.js model handles password hashing and has a matchPassword method!

üß† 3. JWT Token Generation & Cookie Handling
js
Copy code
const token = jwt.sign({ userId: user._id }, process.env.JWT_SECRET_KEY, { expiresIn: '7d' });
res.cookie("token", token, { ... });
Used for authentication after signup/login

Stored in HTTP-only cookies for security

Token is set with sameSite, secure, httpOnly, and maxAge options

üîê httpOnly = client-side JavaScript can‚Äôt access cookie (prevents XSS)

üé≠ 4. Middleware: protectRoute
You need this to:

Extract token from cookie

Verify it using jwt.verify(token, secret)

Attach userId to req.userId

Restrict access to authenticated users only

‚úÖ Protect private routes like:

js
Copy code
router.post("/onboarding", protectRoute, onboard);
üí¨ 5. Stream Chat Integration
You are syncing users to Stream Chat API:

js
Copy code
await upsertStreamUser({
  id: newUser._id.toString(),
  name: newUser.fullName,
  image: newUser.profilePic || "",
});
Uses upsertUsers() to create or update a user in Stream

Keeps user in sync with your app's user

Needs a StreamChat.getInstance(apiKey, apiSecret) client

üîê 6. Logout
js
Copy code
res.clearCookie("token")
Clears the JWT token from browser

Logs user out by removing authentication state

‚ö†Ô∏è You're currently calling res.clearCookie("jwt"), but cookie is set as "token" ‚Äì this needs to match or logout won't work.

‚úÖ Fix:

js
Copy code
res.clearCookie("token");
‚úèÔ∏è 7. To Do: Onboarding Controller
You declared this but haven't implemented:

js
Copy code
export async function onboard(req, res) { }
üîß You can use this to:

Store onboarding details (e.g. interests, bio)

Update user's first-login status

Create a welcome channel in Stream, etc.

 axios
 react query 
 tanstack query :=> TanStack Query (React Query) simplifies working with remote data (like APIs). Instead of manually handling loading, error states, caching, and re-fetching, it does all that for you with hooks like useQuery.


‚úÖ When to Use TanStack Query?
Use it when:

You need to fetch data from APIs.
You want auto caching, re-fetching, and background updates.
Your app grows and you need organized data fetching logic.

‚úÖ What is Axios?
Axios is a promise-based HTTP client for the browser and Node.js, used to send HTTP requests (like GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) to APIs.

It's an alternative to the built-in fetch() method in JavaScript ‚Äî but with more features and a simpler syntax.


For Chat Page
 We Use Get Stream Io Package : npm i  stream-chat stream-chat-react


 -------Chat-------
 const chanelId = [authUser._id, targetUserId].sort().join("-");

üîç The Problem
If you don‚Äôt sort:

If you start the chat, ID becomes:
channelId = "A-B"

If your friend starts the chat, ID becomes:
channelId = "B-A"

‚û°Ô∏è Now you have two different channel IDs for the same two users ‚Äî ‚ùå bad.

‚úÖ The Solution
By using .sort():
[A, B].sort() ‚Üí [A, B]
[B, A].sort() ‚Üí [A, B]
